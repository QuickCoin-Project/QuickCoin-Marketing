                             The goal for QC is to be worth 10 euros.
This is to be done by adaptive blockreward and an ico for an amount of coins.
every 5 minutes the blockreward on the fact that the price need to go up or down regarding price.
blockreward:10=Marketcap/ammount coins if marketcap/ammount of coins isnt 10 the blockreward is the amount of coins that need to be there that the marketcap is 10.
if thats true then the blockreward is spread out over 40 blocks(10 minutes).
if the worth of the coin is 10 or higher there is no blockreward for the coming 10 minutes except for transaction fees.
